# Sql Script Visualizer

### Purpose:
This project is supposed to visualize the database generated by EFC.

It currently works only for SQLite.

When doing the first migration with EFC, you can have EFC output the generated SQL script, with this command (I believe):

`dotnet ef migrations script`

Copy/paste this script into the text area, click the button, and see the diagram generated on the right.\
You can drag individual entities around by dragging the entity header. You can drag the entire diagram, by grabbing the canvas.



## Updates:

* Can now drag entire diagram, by grabbing the checkered background
* Diagram is now shown, seemingly correctly
